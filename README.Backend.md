# Adulting

## Project_4

### Link:

###  Adulting is an application that allows you keep track of your to-do items. Adulting also ecourages you to track daily goals and emotional status. You cam create, view, update, and/or delete tasks on your checklist.

### User Stories 
- User can create new tasks
- User can utilize the update button next to each task that will take them to a form that makes a Put request
- User can utilize the delete button next to each task that will send a delete request 

### Technologies Used 
- Rails
- Postman
- Heroku

### Approach Taken
- generate scaffold to generate migrations, models, controllers, and routes for the checklist model
- create seed data and seed the database
- confirm that I had full CRUD with Postman
- connect backend to frontend with fetch request 
- adjust for CORS so that frontend can consume the backend api
- deployed on Heroku 

### Unsolved Problems
-

### Improvements for Later
- add additional models for errands and appointments
